# NFT Resume

This project was presented as our BS Final Year Project which proposes a new solution to the problem of whitelisting. 

User enters a web3 wallet address and it returns a graphical view of the wallet owner behaviour on-chain. It tracks last 100 transactions of the wallet owner and predicts all five traits of the user if he/she is a Holder, Taker, Whale, OG and Active. This way, NFT Companies can understand their target audience and predict the success of their NFT launch by choosing the appropriate candidates.
